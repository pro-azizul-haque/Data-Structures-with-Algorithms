We’ll start small — implementing a basic cache with Map and finding mutual friends using Set — before diving into logic-driven challenges like Valid Parentheses, Two Sum, and Palindrome Checker that test your thinking precision.


Then, we’ll explore the power of searching and sorting algorithms — from mastering Binary Search and understanding O(log n), to visualizing and implementing Selection Sort and Insertion Sort step by step.
